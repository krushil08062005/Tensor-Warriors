# 1. Introduction
Social media is a double-edged sword: while it enables free communication, it also becomes a medium for cybercrimes, hate speech, and inappropriate content. This project aims to detect such content and predict trending crime topics using AI, NLP, and the MERN stack.

# 2. Problem Statement
Users may unknowingly post harmful content or become victims of cybercrime through social media. Manual moderation is time-consuming and ineffective. There‚Äôs a need for an automated system that:

Detects harmful images or posts.

Alerts authorities or moderators.


# 3. Objectives
Build a web app using the MERN stack.

Integrate Sightengine API to detect harmful content in images (e.g., nudity, violence).

Store all data and analysis results in Supabase (for backend/database).

# 4. Methodology
a. Frontend:
Built using React.js.

User Dashboard: Allows image and text post submission.

Admin Dashboard: Shows flagged content and visual analytics.

b. Backend:
Node.js + Express handles API requests.

Sightengine API integration for image analysis.


c. Database:
Supabase used to store:

Uploaded posts.

Sightengine response data.

User profiles & reports.

# 5. Features
üõ°Ô∏è AI-powered content moderation.

üìà Crime trend dashboard for insights.

üì∏ Image scanning using Sightengine.

üßæ History logs & user reports in Supabase.

# 6. Technologies Used
